# Japanese dialect quiz

A demonstration of using Claude artifacts to write your own [interactive dialect quiz](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html). You can see it in action [right here](https://jsoma.github.io/japanese-dialect-quiz).

# The conversation to generate the app

**🐛 User:** I want to build a react app that is a Japanese dialect quiz. It is a 10-question multiple-choice quiz that asks what word you would to describe certain things, and shows what region you are from based on that.

**🤖 Claude:**  That's an interesting project idea! A React app for a Japanese dialect quiz sounds like a fun and educational tool. I can help you get started with building this app. Let's break it down into components and create a basic structure for the quiz.



```
...
```

This React component creates a basic structure for your Japanese dialect quiz. Here's a breakdown of the main features:

1. The quiz data is stored in the `quizData` array. Currently, it only has one question, but you can easily add more.
2. The `regions` object keeps track of the score for each dialect region.
3. The component uses React hooks (`useState`) to manage the quiz state.
4. It displays one question at a time with radio button options.
5. After answering all questions, it shows the dialect region that most closely matches the user's answers.

To complete this project, you'll need to:

1. Add more questions to the `quizData` array.
2. Possibly refine the scoring system if you want more nuanced results.
3. Add more styling to make the quiz visually appealing.
4. Consider adding more detailed results or explanations about each dialect.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or help you with expanding the quiz questions?

**🐛 User:** I want the words to be in japanese, not romaji

**🤖 Claude:**  Of course, using Japanese characters instead of romaji is a great idea for authenticity. Let's update the quiz to use Japanese characters. I'll modify the existing component to incorporate this change.



```
...
```

I've updated the quiz to use Japanese characters throughout. Here are the main changes:

1. The quiz title is now in Japanese: "日本語方言クイズ" (Japanese Dialect Quiz).
2. Questions and answer options are now in Japanese characters.
3. The region names are also in Japanese: "標準語" (Standard Japanese), "関西弁" (Kansai dialect), and "東北弁" (Tohoku dialect).
4. The "Next" and "Finish" buttons now say "次へ" and "終了" respectively.
5. The result message is in Japanese: "あなたの方言は [結果] に最も近いです。" (Your dialect is closest to [result].)

I've also added a couple more questions to demonstrate how you can expand the quiz. You can continue to add more questions following this pattern.

Here's a brief explanation of the new questions:

2. "「美味しい」をどう言いますか？" (How do you say "delicious"?)
   - おいしい (oishii) - Standard Japanese
   - うまい (umai) - Kansai dialect
   - まんま (manma) - Tohoku dialect

3. "「疲れた」をどう言いますか？" (How do you say "I'm tired"?)
   - つかれた (tsukareta) - Standard Japanese
   - しんどい (shindoi) - Kansai dialect
   - へばった (hebatta) - Tohoku dialect

Remember that these are simplified examples and real dialect differences can be more nuanced. You might want to consult with Japanese language experts or native speakers from different regions to create a more accurate and comprehensive quiz.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code or help you expand the quiz further?

**🐛 User:** I want more dialects! and I want when you answer the question for it to describe what the different answers might mean. I want it to total them up for you at the end to tell you what dialect you 'speak'

**🤖 Claude:**  Certainly! I'll expand the quiz to include more dialects and add explanations for each answer. I'll also modify the result calculation to show you which dialect you "speak" based on your answers. Let's update our React component to incorporate these changes.



```
...
```

Here are the key changes and improvements I've made to the quiz:

1. Added more dialects: We now have five dialects - 標準語 (Standard Japanese), 関西弁 (Kansai), 東北弁 (Tohoku), 沖縄弁 (Okinawan), and 九州弁 (Kyushu).

2. Explanations for answers: After selecting an answer, a brief explanation appears below the options, describing what that particular expression means or where it's commonly used.

3. Detailed results: At the end of the quiz, instead of just showing the most similar dialect, it now displays the percentage for each dialect based on the user's answers.

4. UI improvements: The card width has been increased slightly to accommodate longer dialect names and explanations.

5. More questions can be easily added to the `quizData` array to make the quiz more comprehensive.

To further improve this quiz, you might consider:

1. Adding more questions to cover a wider range of expressions and situations.
2. Including audio clips for each dialect option to help users hear the differences.
3. Providing more detailed information about each dialect at the end of the quiz.
4. Adding a difficulty setting that includes more nuanced dialect differences for advanced learners.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or help you expand the quiz further?

**🐛 User:** I would like this to use React CDN. 

**🤖 Claude:**  Certainly! I'll modify the code to use React via CDN instead of assuming a bundled environment. This approach is great for quickly prototyping or for simpler applications. We'll use the CDN links for React, ReactDOM, and Babel (for JSX support), and we'll also include some basic CSS for styling.



```
...
```

This HTML file contains everything needed to run the Japanese Dialect Quiz using React via CDN. Here are the key changes and points to note:

1. CDN Links: We've included CDN links for React, ReactDOM, and Babel at the top of the file.

2. Inline Styling: Basic CSS is included in a `<style>` tag in the head of the document. This replaces the Tailwind classes we were using before.

3. Single File: All the JavaScript (including React components) is now in a single `<script>` tag with `type="text/babel"`. This allows us to use JSX syntax, which Babel will transform on the fly.

4. React Component: The `QuizApp` component is largely the same as before, but it's now defined as a function component using React hooks.

5. ReactDOM.render: At the bottom of the script, we use `ReactDOM.render` to mount our app to the DOM.

6. HTML Structure: The HTML file includes a `<div id="root">` where our React app will be rendered.

To use this quiz:

1. Save the entire content as an HTML file (e.g., `japanese-dialect-quiz.html`).
2. Open the file in a web browser.

The quiz should work exactly as before, but now it's all contained in a single HTML file and doesn't require any build tools or server setup.

Note that using Babel in the browser is not recommended for production applications due to performance concerns, but it's great for prototyping and learning.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail, or do you want to make any further modifications to the quiz?

**🐛 User:** I would like you to provide a separate artifact with more quizData information, 10 questions

**🤖 Claude:**  Certainly! I'll create a separate artifact with an expanded set of 10 questions for the Japanese dialect quiz. This will allow us to have a more comprehensive quiz without cluttering the main application code.



```javascript
...
```

This new artifact contains an expanded set of 10 questions for the Japanese dialect quiz. Each question includes options for the five dialects we're focusing on: 標準語 (Standard Japanese), 関西弁 (Kansai), 東北弁 (Tohoku), 沖縄弁 (Okinawan), and 九州弁 (Kyushu).

To incorporate this expanded quiz data into your existing React CDN app, you would replace the `quizData` array in the HTML file with this new, larger array. Here's how you can do that:

1. Copy the entire `quizData` array from this new artifact.
2. In your HTML file (the one from the "japanese-dialect-quiz-cdn" artifact), find the existing `quizData` array.
3. Replace the existing array with the new, expanded one.

The rest of your app should work as is, now with 10 questions instead of 3.

This separation of data allows for easier maintenance and expansion of the quiz questions. You can continue to add more questions or modify existing ones in this data file without touching the main application logic.

Would you like me to explain any part of this quiz data in more detail, or do you want to make any further modifications to the quiz?

**🐛 User:** I need a progress bar. maybe we should style using tailwind?

**🤖 Claude:**  Certainly! Adding a progress bar is a great idea to enhance the user experience. And using Tailwind CSS for styling will make it easier to create a responsive and visually appealing design. Let's update our quiz to include a progress bar and switch to Tailwind CSS for styling.

First, let's update our HTML file to include Tailwind CSS and add a progress bar component. We'll also adjust the existing styles to use Tailwind classes.



```
...
```

Here are the key changes and additions:

1. Tailwind CSS: We've added the Tailwind CSS CDN link in the `<head>` section.

2. Progress Bar: A new `ProgressBar` component has been added to show the quiz progress.

3. Styling: All previous inline styles have been replaced with Tailwind CSS classes.

4. Layout: The overall layout has been improved for better responsiveness and visual appeal.

5. Quiz Data: There's a placeholder comment to insert the expanded quiz data from the previous artifact.

To complete the setup:

1. Replace the `quizData` array placeholder with the full array from the "japanese-dialect-quiz-data" artifact.

2. Make sure the `regions` object is defined to match the regions in your quiz data. You can add this just before the `QuizApp` function:

   ```javascript
   const regions = {
     "標準語": 0,
     "関西弁": 0,
     "東北弁": 0,
     "沖縄弁": 0,
     "九州弁": 0,
   };
   ```

This updated version of the quiz now includes:
- A progress bar showing how far along the user is in the quiz
- Improved styling using Tailwind CSS
- Better responsiveness for various screen sizes
- The expanded set of 10 questions (once you add the full `quizData` array)

The quiz should now look more polished and provide a better user experience with the progress bar and improved styling.

Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail, or do you want to make any further modifications to the quiz?
